# An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns

This will Louise see trends in kickstarter campaigns by country, by time frame, by categorical success, and by statistical analysis of the montetary elements.

## General Categorical Success in the US
The following chart shows the number of campaigns, stacked and color-coded according to outcome counts (whether cancelled, failed, live, or successful at reaching their fundraising goal), of each of the different major categories, so you can see how Theater compares to others.
* It shows great promise for Theatrical campaigns, but also some notable risk, calling us to implement a strong strategy!

## Global Outcomes of Play Campaigns
The following chart is similar to the first in its comparisons and information, though it represents all countries, and focuses on sub-types, specifically showing the promise of those focused on Plays.  This, again, should be a strong encouragement as we proceed to more strategic analysis.
* For specific information on Edinburgh plays, see the related sheet in this report file.  It includes general average donor figures.

## Timing the Campaign
The following chart shows the outcomes of theatrical campaigns compared to the timing of when they were run.
* Notice the May and June show a notable spike in success that tapers off over the remainder of the year.

## Financial Statistics
The following chart shows the spread and collection of figures for British campaigns- specifically comparing the goals that were set and the pledges that came in.
* It should be noted that a goal of 4000 pounds is significantly above the cluster of pledges that are closer to 2000.  While it is not impossible to see the high stretch of the figures, it would be statistically safer to consider a lower goal for your additional idea of the British theatre.
